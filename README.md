Check out the files 'BBGVI.py', 'Loss.py', 'Divergence.py' to get an idea about what object oriented programming looks like in practice once you have read up on it/done tutorials.

If you want to run some code, you can run the files 'GVI_BLR.py' (for GVI applied to Bayesian Linear Regression [BLR]) or 'GVI_BMM.py' (for GVI applied fr Bayesian Mixture Models [BMM]). You will need to change lines 223 / 158 to your local repository.
